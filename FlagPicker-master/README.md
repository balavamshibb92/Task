Code Challenge: Flag Picker

 

Challenge: 

Build a generic search component that allows the user to pick different world flags based on the provided JSON file (attached to this email). 

 

Instructions: 

1. Build a generic search box  functionality with MVC framework and UI Tech of your choice. 

2. Filter these options based on the user's input (typeahead functionality)

3. Use the continents as the options for the first search box. The options for this search box should be clickable and, when selecting an option, it should filter the second search box options

4. Use the countries as the options for the second search box. The options for this search box should be checkboxes that allow the user to select multiple countries

5. Display country flags based on the options selected in the second search box

5. Build Unit tests for your search box component 

6. Feel free to style the page however you’d like, but the functionality should resemble the video as closely as possible

 

Bonus: 

1. Scale and performance considerations

 

Time limit for the challenge: 24 hours
